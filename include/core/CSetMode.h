//! \brief
//! Portable wrapper for the Windows _setmode(fd, mode) function.
//!
//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Set the input streams translation mode.
//! Input streams can be in various text modes or binary.
//! In binary mode end-of-line translation does not take place
//! and ascii character 26 (end-of-transmission) is ignored.
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! This has been broken into a class of its own because it is
//! a Windows specific function. There is no need for an equivalent
//! call on *nix as *nix input streams don't interperet ascii
//! character code 26 as end of transmission (the character send by
//! pressing Ctrl D on Windows).
//!

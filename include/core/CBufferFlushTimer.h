//! DESCRIPTION:\n
//! Class to hide the complexity of establishing when
//! and how to flush a buffer
//!
//! IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS:\n
//! In typical live use, the buffer is flushed
//! at the maxTime - bufferDelay.
//!
//! If no events have arrived this breaks as events
//! between maxTime and maxTime - bufferDelay never
//! get flushed.
//!
//! To avoid the method will return maxtime if
//! maxTime hasn't changed for bufferDelay clock seconds.
//!
